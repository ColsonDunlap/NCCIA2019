16. Yeah!||2004 Usher Feat. Lil Jon & Ludacris||In 2004, R&B and hip-hop's dominance was undeniable, and “Yeah!” perfectly captured the day's hottest sounds: Usher's smooth vocals, Ludacris' light-hearted rhymes and Lil Jon's crunk-R&B production. The Atlanta trio was rewarded with 12 weeks atop the Hot 100, but R&B and hip-hop were 2004's real MVPs: A person of color performed every Hot 100 No. 1 that year.||Theo Wargo/WireImage||Usher & Lil Wayne||
